Please note that this program takes advantage of the fact that once a condition is met,
the if structure is exited. This allows me to not need a lower limit in my conditions
because
if the speed were below the minimum for that Category, theprogram would
have already printed the result and exited.

elif speed <= 95:

elif speed <= 110:
    print ("Category 2")
